# Gusto is a recipe app that helps you find recipes depending on what you have in your pantry/freezer/fridge.

## :construction: WIP building Gusto with nextjs, strapi & material UI.

### This is just a sandbox/learning project where I practice on implementing a Figma design & some new technologies I haven't worked with :)

### Only done for mobile view due to assignment specs, so I didn't spend any time at all fixing or thinking about desktop
